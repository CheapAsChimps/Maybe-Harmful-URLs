# Maybe-Harmful-URLs

These are a collection of links that could potentially lead to browser pop-ups or phishing websites.

Updated regularly with dead links removed.

One file includes all links that have some sort of HTTP response, the other file shows links that only redirect. There is also a shorter list of links that are included on the latest list, but not on the previous one.

#### ONLY OPEN THESE LINKS IN A VIRTUAL MACHINE

I use the following command in a ubuntu-based system to generate 10 random URLs: 

    shuf -n 10 file.txt

The following website is what I use to open up multiple URLs at once: https://url-opener.com/
